## Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Lucas!

I'm a data scientist at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) and in the powertrain development at Mercedes-Benz. Here's a few facts about me:
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on anomaly detection in time series data and writing my PhD thesis on it.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a bit of Rust/PyO3 to make my data processing functions more performant.
